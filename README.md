## Comic Relief Pattern Lab
> it's a node-based experimental project to supply sass component as well as styleguide generator

## The idea
To have a centralised hub supply common styling across CR products. 

## Styleguide
* generated by [kss-node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node)
* support twig template
* multiple entries
* view on
  - `/dist/index.html`
  - `/dist/[project_name]/index.html`

## Import styling to a project
* run `npm install @comicrelief/pattern-lab --save`
* on local scss file, add `@import '~pattern-lab';` 

  (or use `includePaths: ['node_modules']` in grunt-sass `options` configuration)
* or copy css file straight to your project 

## Contribute styling to pattern-lab
### Workflow 
#### Get it up and running!
* run `git clone https://github.com/comicrelief/pattern-lab pattern-lab`
* run `cd /[project-name]` go to project folder you want to include pattern-lab 
* run `npm install npm-link-local --save` 
* run `npm-link-local [path-to-pattern-lab]` it creates symlink of `./node_modules/pattern-lab`. It means whatever change on `/pattern-lab`, it will reflect on `[project-name]`
#### Make code changes
* it follows same development process: create feature branch -> commit and push changes -> create pull request for code review
* run `npm run watch` to liveload file changes
* run `npm run build` to generate styleguide

#### Deployment
* CI will excute `npm run deploy` once merged into `master`
* to bump npm version number and publish the package
